# My [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) Config

My rule is no cloud based apps, everything must run local, no subscription fees, and the hardware must have Home Assistant integration. I don't want 20 different apps to manage 20 different devices, I don't want my house to become unusable when my internet is offline, and I don't want devices that can be bricked when a manufacturer decides to [turn off their servers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/05/revolv-devices-bricked-google-nest-smart-home) or [not renew a certificate](https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2017/11/after-online-outrage-logitech-will-now-replace-harmony-link-devices-for-free/).

My HA installation runs on a Pi 3 with the following:

Software
--------
* [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv)
* [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) *for Apple HomeKit Support*
* [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) *for network-wide adblocker*
* [PiVPN](http://www.pivpn.io/) *for VPN into my house from anywhere*
* [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) *for the SSL on my HA domain*

Hardware
--------
* 1 x [Foscam FI8918W](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0046710G6) for a PTZ camera in my toddler's room which I've then configured using HA scripts to allow me to point at three different locations in the room
* 2 x [Foscam FI9800P](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B015STDPJ0) - one for the front of the house, one for the back
* 1 x [Foscam C1 Lite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0196AN3IU) for the landing
* 1 x [Foscam C1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00T7NX6SY/) for the hallway
* 2 x [Fibaro FGMS-001 Motion Sensor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00JHHNUPY/) ([manual](http://manuals.fibaro.com/content/manuals/en/FGMS-001/FGMS-001-EN-T-v2.1.pdf)) for motion and temperature (it does brightness too but I'm not making use of that yet)
* 1 x [Aeotec USB Z-Stick S5](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00YETCNOE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) plugged into the Pi to interface with the z-wave devices

Floorplan
--------
![UI](/images/floorplan.png)

* Dark grey rooms can't be controlled as they have no zwave lights in yet
* Light grey rooms mean they've got controllable lights, and a tap on the room will toggle them
* Yellow rooms are rooms with lights already turned on
* The diagonally hatched rooms are rooms with currently detected motion

Automation
--------
`// todo: document`

High level overview:
- My office lights are automated. When I walk in the room they turn on, and after 10 minutes of  no motion they turn off
- When neither my wife or I am home, my internal cameras begin recording and my motion sensors will send a Slack alert when motion is detected
- The underlights on my bed turn on automatically at 7pm and off at 7am
- My wife's electric blanket turns on at 6:30pm and off at 11pm
- The Christmas lights on the front of the house turn on at sunset and off at 7am
- When my wife or I arrive home the internal camera recording is disabled, the motion sensors stop alerting, and the dining room light turns on (it's the closest to the driveway)
- Slack notifications when a new HA update is available

Whenever any automation fires I get a Slack update to let me know what's going on.
